Description: Leaflet Javascript library provides many plugins some of which
    are available in the core leaflet package, but there are many more. It is not
    possible to support them all in the core leaflet package. This package serves
    as an addon to the leaflet pacakge by providing extra functionality via leaflet
    plugins.
